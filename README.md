# Machine Learning Assisted GST

Final year project for MEng. Computer Science at the University of Bristol. Current working title:

> Facilitating the calibration of complex quantum photonic circuits with machine learning 
> assisted gate set tomography

At the moment, this repository is just for my dissertation notes and introduction chapters.

## Paper

Paper can be found in `build/main.pdf`. If you want to build it yourself for whatever reason, run:


```bash
cd src
make build
